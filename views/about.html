        <h3>About</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Every software company uses some kind of revision control. Isn't it shocking then that students often make it through their entire four years of undergrad CS without learning how to use source control tools?</p>
        <p>The GitSubmit team posits that one possible reason this happens is that the workflow that comes with available revision control tools and platforms do not mesh well with the workflow of academia: professors need ways to keep students accountable that donâ€™t fit into the corporate world and use cases.</p>
        <p>GitSubmit provides a solution for tracking and submitting source code that relates to academic projects and assignments. GitSubmit provides many of the functions that exist in other great platforms such as <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>, but with a focus on academic use cases. This gives professors peace of mind while allowing students to learn valuable Source Control concepts and technologies they will use every day in their professions.</p>
        <p>GitSubmit is built with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask (python)</a>, <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize CSS</a>, and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. GitSubmit was developed as a Senior Design project in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering & Computer Science during the fall of 2015. GitSubmit is <a href="https://github.com/gitsubmit">free open source software!</a></p>
